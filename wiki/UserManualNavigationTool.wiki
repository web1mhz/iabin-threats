== Species Menu ==

Species Option initially contains a button for search http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/search-button.png of the species you wish to view. When clicking on this button opens a popup which are the following:

http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/menuspecies.png

1.	Search for species, which enter the name or part of the name of the species you want to search.

2.	Menu type initial tree species.

3.	Close the popup and return to the map and main menu.

Below are the two types of searches you can perform on the popup menu of species:

== Menu search tree species using ==

http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/menu-species-tree.png

You can make the search for a species using the species tree each time you select an option will display the information it contains, to reach the kind that needs to view, click once on it will close the popup and A menu like the following:

== Data visualization of the species ==

http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/dataspecie.png

1.	Search button, open the popup again to search for a new species.

2.	Show info button opens a new window showing the information of the species, details of modeling, threat status, condition and ecosystems where it is.

http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/specieInfo.png

(1)	control to show and hide information ecosystems.

3.  Clear button, clean Species menu options and map.

4.  Option that displays the occurrences (kml points) of the selected species on the map.

5.  Option that shows the convex hull (polygon kml) of selected species on the map.

6.  Option that shows the convex hull buffer (polygon kml) of selected species on the map.

7.  Option that displays a png layer on the map of the distribution of the species limited by the convex hull.

8.  Control to display and hide the image of scale and opacity control.

9.  Scale image.

10. Opacity bar where you can change the opacity of the selected layer from 0% to 100%.

11. Option that displays a png layer on the map of the distribution of the species.

12. Option that displays a png layer on the threshold map for the species.
Also you can search for a species using the form, this will enter the full name and click on search.

== Menu Finder species using species ==

http://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/searchspecie.png
