= Introduction =

This tools provide the ability to convert shape and csv files to kml files and to convert raster files to png images, so that these data can be shown through the web interface using google maps.


= Details =

*ShapeFile*

The first part is the shape file conversion, this reads the shapefile from the path specified in the [http://code.google.com/p/iabin-threats/wiki/IabinProperties iabin.properties file], then processes it and the places the result kml files into the path specified in the iabin.properties file and the folder summaries, the required files have the following extensions:  .shp .shx .dbf (these are mandatory)
following files are optional : 
.prj .sbn .sbx .fbn .fbx .ain .aih .ixs .mxs .atx .atx .shp .xml .cpg

this is how the path is described in the iabin.properties file:<br>
shapes= PA       <<----- PA: protected Areas<br>
PA.group= summaries <<---- Summaries: is the folder where the files are going to be written<br>
PA.shapefile=SurAmerica.shp <<--- Source Filename<br>
The iabin.properties file must be filled with the variable names and values in lower case.

*CsvFile*
The csv file, whose source filename is the specie's id and output filename aggregates the word -point, provides the specie's code, longitude and latitude as seen on this example:
<br>
taxon,lon,lat<br>
101616,-69.493057,-12.995277<br>
these data are converted to kml files in order to be shown as points of ocurrences on google maps
For the polygon csv files, named by specie's id plus chull and chull-buff words, are composed by two columns as shown in the next example:
<br>
lon,lat<>br
-64.375,-20.82999992<br>

after grabbing these data the program will merge them together to build one kml file for each specie containing the chull and chull-buff information, theses files are left in the species folder and subfolder with specie's id

*KmlFile*

These are the output files that google maps interprets to show the points, and polygons, these have the .kml extension.

*project explanation*
the whole project is composed by five packages, csv2kml, general, shape2kml, tilecutter and utils, 
-the csv2kml classes function is to read the csv files and convert them into the kml files
-the general file is where the main code resides and this one calls all the processes involved in the conversion
-shape2kml contains the classes that permit to convert shapefiles to kml, this is only for the protected areas part
-tilecutter contains the code necessary to create the png images from the raster files, this images are all tiled in little images that permit to reduce load to the page, these images depend on the zoom factor and bioclim variable
-utils contains the classes which allow to create the properties file when there is no file, and also handles the properties file use.
