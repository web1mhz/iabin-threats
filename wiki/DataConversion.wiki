The first part is the shape file conversion, this reads the shapefile from the path specified in the [iabin.properties file http://code.google.com/p/iabin-threats/wiki/IabinProperties], then processes it and the places the result kml files into the path specified in the iabin.properties file and the folder summaries, the required files have the following extensions:  .shp .shx .dbf (these are mandatory)
following files are optional : 
.prj .sbn .sbx .fbn .fbx .ain .aih .ixs .mxs .atx .atx .shp .xml .cpg

this is how the path is described in the iabin.properties file:
shapes= PA       <<----- PA: protected Areas
PA.group= summaries <<---- Summaries: is the folder where the files are going to be written
PA.shapefile=SurAmerica.shp <<--- Source Filename
The iabin.properties file must be fill with the variable name in upper case, and the value in lower case.
