This is a technical document and is intended to people who has relation with the technical implementation of the project.

The purpose of this document is to illustrate how to build the project from the source code of this repository.

== Technical Requirements ==

* 250GB-500GB of HD space available for database (while importing process), 30GB for shape files and bioclimatic variables files. 
* Latest version of JRE, available for free at [http://www.java.com http://www.java.com]

== Configuring MySQL Database ==



== Configuring Files ==

The project needs some extra XML files that should be configured before start to run it (*client_config.xml* and *server_config.xml*).

As the _svn_ command doesn't import these files, ITA project can generate them assigning default values that you should change later, depending of your file system and your personal configuration.
