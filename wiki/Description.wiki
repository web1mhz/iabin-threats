Recent developments in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM) applications have added value to data, and permit researchers to provide highly policy-relevant analyses to direct conservation interventions. Through the most recent ENM techniques, potential distributions of species can be analyzed using fairly limited or biased datasets containing primary data to determine current biodiversity hotspots (Phillips et al. 2006; Elith et al. 2006; Hijmans and Graham 2006), and likely threats from anthropogenic activities (Jarvis et al. 2009) and climate change (IPCC 2007) in order to deﬁne current and future in situ and ex situ conservation priorities (Walker et al. 2009; Bass et al. 2010).

However, one of the most relevant issues regarding the analyses and latter conclusions derived from the usage of primary biodiversity data is the reliance on its quality. Poor quality biodiversity data could lead to incorrect and biased conclusions as well as cause ineﬃcient and/or wrong investment of the available resources and inadequate policy development. Checking of biodiversity data quality as well as adequate use is a key issue in order to aid decision-making processes. We intend to (1) assess and improve the quality of IABIN's terrestrial holdings using automated scripts, (2) use the primary biodiversity data to develop niche models, (3) couple those results to assess the extent at which South American biodiversity is both under threat and conserved by the current Protected Areas network, and (4) implement an interface through which all results can be accessed and viewed by policy-makers. We have automated algorithms developed in the Java programming language that allow a thorough coordinate veriﬁcation process, which have been used on the GBIF (The Global Biodiversity Information Facility) database, and through which the whole database was veriﬁed for consistency of location data. Some 85% of the data was found to be correct at three different levels (Fig. 2). The same assessment will be done for all IABIN holdings in the ﬁrst place.

We acknowledge the importance of the relationship between biodiversity and socio-economy, and the reliance of human beings on biodiversity and high quality ecosystem services. We, therefore, consider it fundamental to assess the level at which biodiversity is threatened and conserved across the globe, and particularly (given IABIN’s focus) in Latin America, where the presence of signiﬁcant biodiversity ‘hotspots’ (e.g. Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park, the Guyana Shield, the Amazon forest, among others) make conservation strategies critical towards the near and long term future. Strong methodologies to assess the impacts of anthropogenic activities will be developed and at least one peer reviewed publication will be pursued using the results of the modeling and cross-checking of coordinates.

1.1.	The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the regulatory framework to develop and integrate tools in Spanish and English oriented to improve primary data quality and reliance including:  (i) assess and improve the quality of IABIN’s terrestrial holdings using automated scripts; (ii) use the primary biodiversity data to develop niche models; (iii) couple those results to assess the extent at which South American taxa are both under threat and conserved by the current Protected Areas Network; and (iv) implement an interface through which all results will be made available to policy-makers (hereinafter the “Project”).

1.2.	This Agreement will augment ongoing efforts within IABIN to integrate, visualize and make available data digitized and standardized by IABIN and its partners. These efforts include the IABIN Data Integration and Analysis Center (DIAC)which will utilize the Data Basin platform (www.databasin.org), developed by the Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) and built on ESRI Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software. The DIAC will upload, display, and analyze the data resulting from IABIN’s granting effort under Component 2 of the IABIN GEF project.  Users will be able to browse Component 2 data, as well as complementary layers from other sources, search across a range of geographic and thematic fields, and perform analyses of this data, all in a bilingual (English and Spanish) environment.. CIAT’s activities under this Agreement will assist CBI´s Data Basin and IABIN’s Thematic Networks to ensure the highest quality biodiversity data is included in the IABIN DIAC and IABIN TNs  CIAT will: (1) assess and improve the quality of IABIN's terrestrial holdings using automated scripts, (2) use the primary biodiversity data to develop ecological niche models, (3) couple those results to assess the extent at which South American biodiversity is both under threat and conserved by the current Protected Areas network, and (4) implement an interface through which all results can be accessed and viewed by policy-makers (5) publish a peer-review journal about the IABIN DIAC data integration process along with IABIN Team and CBI-Data Basin.


3.1.	No later than two (2) months after the date of signature of the Agreement by both Parties, the Institution shall deliver to GS/OAS and to GS/OAS’ satisfaction an interim technical-financial progress report of the Project (“First Report”) in conformity with Annex 6 of this Agreement. The Report shall include the progress made on the products planned in the proposal as these are defined in Annex 8 including the following activities:

Activity 1	Cross checking of coordinates scripts: Finalize and implement a Java-based algorithm to cross-check coordinates of IABIN’s terrestrial biodiversity data.
Activity 2	Georreferencing Script: Finalize and implement a Java-based algorithm to add value to non-georreferenced records within the IABIN Network.
Activity 3	Assessment of all IABIN records: Assess all the primary data using the algorithms in Activities 1 and 2 and provide IABIN with a detailed evaluation of all its primary biodiversity data.

Based on progress achieved in Activities 1, 2 and 3, CIAT will submit a report to OAS detailing the checking and georeferencing of all relevant data in IABIN’s Thematic Networks.  Within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Report, GS/OAS shall review it and notify the Institution in writing that the Report is either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  If the report is unsatisfactory, GS/OAS shall further notify the Institution in writing of what the Institution must do to make the Report satisfactory and the Institution shall have another thirty days to do so from the date it receives that notice.

3.2.	No later than four (4) months after the date of signature of the Agreement by both Parties, the Institution shall deliver to GS/OAS and to GS/OAS’ satisfaction an interim technical-financial progress report of the Project (“Second Report”) in conformity with Annex 6 of this Agreement. The Report shall include the progress made on the products planned in the proposal as these are defined in Annex 8 including the following deliverables:

Activity 4	Training of niche models script: Finalize and implement a Java-based algorithm for the training of niche models (using a maximum entropy approach) and apply it to taxa with enough data in South America.
Activity 5	Threat and Conservation Assesment: overlay the developed geographic distributions with ecosystem threat and protected areas layers, generate analysis metrics to provide the necessary background data for scenario assessment and policy making for South America.
Activity 6	Beta version of the tool

How to make the data reliable enough?
 * Verify coordinates at different levels
 * Are the records where they say they are?
 * Are the records inside land areas (for terrestrial plant species only)
 * Are all the records within the environmental niche of the taxon?
 * Sea records: not verifiable
 * Correct wrong references
 * Add references to those that do not have
 * Cross-check with curators and feedback the database
