== Introduction ==

The Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) has the mandate of providing a networking information infrastructure as well as primary biodiversity data on a number of topics in order to improve decision-making, particularly for issues at the interface of human development and biodiversity conservation. During the late 2010, IABIN has approved funds for projects aiming to (a) develop IABIN; and (b) provide the necessary instruments to draw knowledge from the information contained in the network mentioned to support sound decision-making concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Under that framework, IABIN has funded the Decision and Policy Analysis Program (DAPA) at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) on a project entitled *"Improve primary data and use it for threat assessment and in situ conservation planning in South America"*. More specifically, we intend to assess and improve the geographic quality of the primary data provided by the different IABIN Thematic Networks (TNs) using a scientifically rigorous and mostly automated approach. The data will then be used in a variety of modelling and statistical exercises aiming to derive practical conclusions on the conservation status of Biodiversity, and finally, a web interface for policy-makers to navigate throughout all our results will be provided. More specifically, the project will deliver:

1. Automatic cross-checking scripts
2. Automatic georeferencing scripts
3. Results on both the cross-checking and georeferencing of the TNs with suitable databases for such purposes (SSTN, I3N and PTN)
4. Automatic species distribution models training scripts
5. An assessment of level of both anthropogenic threats and conservation status for a number of species (for which geographic distributions can be modelled)
6. A Google-maps based navigation tool for all the modelling results (from [5])


== Rationale ==

Recent developments in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM) applications have added value to data, and permit researchers to provide highly policy-relevant analyses to direct conservation interventions. Through the most recent ENM techniques, potential distributions of species can be analyzed using fairly limited or biased datasets containing primary data to determine current biodiversity hotspots (Phillips et al. 2006; Elith et al. 2006; Hijmans and Graham 2006), and likely threats from anthropogenic activities (Jarvis et al. 2009) and climate change (IPCC 2007) in order to deﬁne current and future in situ and ex situ conservation priorities (Walker et al. 2009; Bass et al. 2010).

However, one of the most relevant issues regarding the analyses and latter conclusions derived from the usage of primary biodiversity data is the reliance on its quality. Poor quality biodiversity data could lead to incorrect and biased conclusions as well as cause ineficient and/or wrong investment of the available resources and inadequate policy development. Checking of biodiversity data quality as well as adequate use is a key issue in order to aid decision-making processes, and equally important is increasing the impact of such data on policy-making processes and the society. Making use of freely online available spatial datasets plus some programming this is now doable not only at a large scale but also in a mostly automated way. Following sections will briefly describe each of the deliverables of this project.



We acknowledge the importance of the relationship between biodiversity and socio-economy, and the reliance of human beings on biodiversity and high quality ecosystem services. We, therefore, consider it fundamental to assess the level at which biodiversity is threatened and conserved across the globe, and particularly (given IABIN’s focus) in Latin America, where the presence of signiﬁcant biodiversity ‘hotspots’ (e.g. Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park, the Guyana Shield, the Amazon forest, among others) make conservation strategies critical towards the near and long term future. Strong methodologies to assess the impacts of anthropogenic activities will be developed and at least one peer reviewed publication will be pursued using the results of the modeling and cross-checking of coordinates. For further information, please contact Andy Jarvis, leader of the Decision and Policy Analysis program at CIAT (a.jarvis@cgiar.org).


== Phase 1: Development of automated tools, assessment and improvement of IABIN TNs primary biodiversity data ==

One of the most relevant issues regarding the analyses and latter conclusions derived from the usage of primary biodiversity data is the reliance on its quality. We have built automated algorithms (Figure 1) developed in the Java programming language that allow a thorough coordinate verification process (error detection) and georeferencing process (error correction). Through this process we intend to develop an automated platform for IABIN’s TNs to assess their own data whenever more data is incorporated on any of their databases.

But, how to make the data reliable enough?

 * Verify coordinates at different levels
  * Are the records where they say they are?
  * Are the records inside land areas (for terrestrial plant species only)
  * Are all the records within the environmental niche of the taxon?
 * Correct wrong references
 * Add references to those that do not have
 * Cross-check with curators and feedback the database

Adequate documentation on how to build, configure and run the tools is also provided in order to better manage knowledge transfer between and within TNs, and between TNs and project developers (see the table of contents in the left of this page). This googlecode project has been created with the aim of storing and providng access to all the source code and documentation, and also providing a platform where where bugs and problems can be raised as issues and discussed with developers.


=== Cross-checking of coordinates ===

Here we are concerned about the geographic errors. Common errors in primary biodiversity databases are (1) misspellings of country, state, county and locality names, (2) swapping of latitude or longitude, (3) assignation of the value zero when missing data is found, (4) coordinates in different systems or unknown systems, (5) wrong usage of decimal places or truncation of all decimals, (6) usage of different coordinate formats (e.g. degrees-minutes-seconds vs. decimal degrees) without proper documenting, among others.

In view of that we have developed and implemented automated Java software that runs in batch mode and assesses primary biodiversity data from large databases automatically, and provides statistics on the quality of the data. Our software verifies geographic references (coordinates) at three different levels (Figure 2):
 # Continental level
 # Country level
 # Environmental level

To verify at the continental level, we use a high resolution land areas mask from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model coastlines (Jarvis et al., 2008); to verify at the country level, we use the data from the Global Administrative Areas (Hijmans, 2010); and to verify at the environmental level, we use the Tukey outlier test (Tukey, 1977) in a twenty-dimensional space given by 19 bioclimatic indices (Ramirez &  Bueno-Cabrera, 2009) derived from the WorldClim dataset (Hijmans et al., 2005) and the elevation (Jarvis et al., 2008). We flag a record as reliable only if it:

 # Is located in the country where it is reported to have been collected and/or observed
 # Being a record from a terrestrial species, falls within land areas, and
 # Is not flagged as an outlier for a given species in less than 80% of the 20 environmental variables used to describe the environment

=== Correction of coordinates ===

Even when a coordinate verification process is implemented, it does not directly imply that the best-bet is being done from the available data. A quality improvement process is still required in order to be able to use the best-shaped data in further analyses. Geographically speaking, this means the retrieval of coordinates when they are either unavailable or erroneous. Using biogeomancer (Guralnick &  Hill, 2009, Guralnick et al., 2006, Hill et al., 2009), one can retrieve the coordinates of a particular location by means of the collecting place information provided in the database (e.g. country, state, county, and locality name). Though the location information is not available in all the cases when also the coordinates are lacking, it is available in a number of cases and can be retrieved with a considerable degree of confidence (Hill et al., 2009)

In this particular case, we have developed software that uses all the records flagged as not reliable (from the automatic data filtering and cross-checking), is capable of 

 # Identifying the records that have enough location information to retrieve a coordinate, 
 # querying the biogeomancer service at http://bg.berkeley.edu/latest/
 # interpreting the result from the biogeomancer service, and 
 # adding the retrieved coordinate to the database.
