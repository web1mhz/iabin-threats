== Technical Requirements ==

 * Apache Subversion SVN Client. [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html Get it].
 * Apache Maven. [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Get it]
 * Java JRE version 6 or higher. [http://www.java.com/ Get it]

== 1. Checking out the source code ==

Check out the [http://code.google.com/p/iabin-threats/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ita ita project] of this repository.

 svn checkout https://iabin-threats.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ita ita

The instructions for checking out from Google Code's SVN can be found [http://code.google.com/p/iabin-threats/source/checkout here]


== 2. Organizing code for Eclipse IDE ==

Once the source code has been checked out, if you want to organize it as a Eclipse IDE project, run the command:

 mvn eclipse:eclipse

== 3. Compiling project ==

If you want to compile the project to get the binaries, run the command:

 mvn compile

It creates the /target/classes directory where you can find the compiled classes
and the /target/rmi-classes where you can find the Stub classes to run the project using Remote Method Invocation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation Java RMI]

== 4. Packaging project ==

If you want to deploy the .jar file of the project, run the command:

 mvn package

Then you can find the .jar in the /target directory, named _ita_ with the current version of the project _e.g. ita-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar_

Compiling step is not necessary since packaging includes the compiling process to create the jar
