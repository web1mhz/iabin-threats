#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

Here is the description of the iabin.properties file, this one holds the configuration data needed for the project to run, mostly there are source and target paths, image colors , style url and more




= Properties File Example =

-----------------------------------------
- PATH  
- source and target path of files
-----------------------------------------

path.source=c:/data/
path.target=c:/iabinmaps/

-this is the folder inside path.source and path.target where files are written to and read from
bioclim.path=bioclim/
threat.path=threat/
species.path=species/
summaries.path=summaries/
summaries.kmloutputpath=protectedArea/

-----------------------------------------
- RASTERS 
- Name of raster files that are going to be converted into PNG format
-----------------------------------------

rasters=P1;P2;P3
P1.group=bioclim
P1.filename=P1.asc
P2.group=bioclim
P2.filename=P2.asc

----------------------------------------
- SHAPEFILES 
- Name of files that are going to be converted into KML format
----------------------------------------

shapes= PA  
PA is the folder that is created inside summaries
PA.group= summaries
PA.shapefile=SurAmerica.shp

----------------------------------------
- ZOOM  
- minimum and maximum zoom that is going to be applied to bioclim, threats and richness raster files
----------------------------------------

zoom.min=0
zoom.max=1

----------------------------------------
- KML Style
- style.url holds the style url that is going to be applied to KML files
- http://wikipedia.agilityhoster.com/estilo.kml this part is the host and folder of style file and "#estilo" is the ID of the style that wants to be applied 
----------------------------------------


style.url=http://wikipedia.agilityhoster.com/estilo.kml#estilo


----------------------------------------
- PROTECTED AREA 
- The conversion of these polygons into KML is made by reading a shapefile that in this case is in path contained in "path.source"+ "summaries.path", and generating a main kml, from which
- the other kml files, that form the polygons, are called, each polygon shows a table which is made with the values that are received in variable 
- "PA.shape.column.indexes" and the values of "PA.shape.column.names" are settled as column names. 
- 
- PA.server.url holds the server address where MKL files are going to be hosted 
- PA.shape.column.indexes Holds the features of shapefiles of protected areas that is wanted to be shown , includes column name, 
- PA.shape.column.names holds the name that is going to be given to each column, and 
- PA.kml.main holds the name of main KML (from which the other polygon KMLs are called)
----------------------------------------


PA.server.url=http://wikipedia.agilityhoster.com/         
PA.shape.column.indexes=2;4;5;20
PA.shape.column.names=Name;Country;State;UNCAT
PA.kml.main=mainKML.kml


----------------------------------------
- COLORS 
- The colors that are going to be applied to raster files include type, scale, minimum color and maximum one.
- P1.color.type "P1" is the name of the raster file p1.asc - the types that may exist are "temperature", "precipitation", "threats", "Species distribution"
- "temperature", "precipitation", "threats" always take continuous values
- Species "distribution" take discrete values fixed or quantiles
- current species "richness" take discrete values fixed or quantiles
- temperature.color.min (max) the minimum (maximum) temperature color written in RGB format in decimal (255;255;255)
- temperature.scale= may take discrete values "quantiles" or "fixed" or take continuous values "continuous"
- temperature.scale.quantiles the value is decimal representing the number of quantiles in which the scale will be splitted  - by default 5 or 6 
- temperature.scale.fixed gets the threshold value, this takes 100 as value by default
- temperature.scale.continuous This does not get any value because the scale is degradated from minimum to maximum color
----------------------------------------


P1.color.type=temperature
P2.color.type=precipitation

temperature.color.min= 255;255;0
temperature.color.max= 255;0;0

temperature.scale=quantiles
temperature.scale.quantiles=5

precipitation.color.min= 255;255;255
precipitation.color.max= 0;0;255

precipitation.scale=continuous
